            <p className='mb-3'>Hello! My name is Minh Le. I'm a web and mobile developer who enjoys solving both programming and real-world problems. I has been programming since 2017, which focused on front-end web programming mostly. From 2019, I have been working as a fullstack developer in both web and mobile app and also start to gain knowledge about game development. I love to learn about algorithms and apply them to solve mathematical/programming problems. Besides, I love to develop software solution to solve real-life problem of myself or my communities. If there is any project that want to collaborate with me, feel free to reach out to me.</p>
            <p>This is my resume. I'm currently open to any intern/new-grad opportunity for Fall/Winter 2021 and Spring/Summer 2022.</p>
